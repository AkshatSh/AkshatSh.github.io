When tuning the architecture and hyperparameters of large machine learning models for on-device deployment, it is desirable to understand the optimal trade-offs between on-device latency and model accuracy. In this work, we leverage recent methodological advances in Bayesian optimization over high-dimensional search spaces and multi-objective Bayesian optimization to efficiently explore these trade-offs for a production-scale on-device natural language understanding model at Facebook.
