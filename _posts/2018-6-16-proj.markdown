* We wanted to build an incredibly simple IoT Solution for tracking perishables, so that you'd never waste food due to expiration dates again.
* A user can scan a receipt of groceries, and ReFresh will tag and aggregate the purchased items and display them with an expiration timer
* Users are able to take advantage of Postmates to re-order their food items as the expiration date approaches
* ReFresh suggests recipes that use the expiring ingredients and sends text message reminders as items are nearing expiration (via Twilio)

**Languages**: `javascript`, `HTML`, `CSS`
**Technologies**: `node.js`, `HTML5`
